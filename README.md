# DF Compiler
**DF Compiler** is a compiler for a language made for _DiamondFire_

[DiamondFire](https://mcdiamondfire.com/about/) is a Minecraft server where you can create your own games. With a visual programming language based on regular blocks and items, you can create games without any prior coding knowledge. (It's in some ways similar to Scratch)

---

As of writing this, DF Compiler (name to be changed) supports the following:
- Functions
- Variables (line, game, saved, local)
- Code blocks (with targets)
- Lists, Dictionaries
  - _Note_: Missing methods (.append, .pop, .extend, ...)\
  _As a temporary solution you can access the code blocks for these_
- Expressions with proper order of operations
  - _Note_: Not fully finished, currently limited to numbers only

Todo:
- Events
- Game Values
- Item/Block Values
- Location Values
- Selections (a select statement perhaps)
